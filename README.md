# Cuphead for PS VITA (VERY EARLY VERSION)

This repo contains patches that you can use in order to get fully working files for my port.

**YOU NEED TO BUY THE GAME ON STEAM TO MAKE IT WORK!**

NOTICE: ONLY WINDOWS VERSION IS SUPPORTED, You also need ioplus plugin installed.

Don't try to launch the game, because it will crash without the neccesary files.

Known Issues:
- Contains only World 1 due to on demanding fight with the RAM
- Some Textures will be low resolution to avoid Ram related issues
- Some of the AudioClips are heavily compressed to avoid issues with RAM
- Some of the scenes may cause game to crash after restarting(Working on Fixing it)


## STEAM VERSION
- Go to the Release page and download ``CupheadVitaSteam.zip``.
- Extract it.
- Put the game's folder(```..\steamapps\common\Cuphead```) inside the extracted folder(Should be Steam version).)
- Launch ``ApplyPatch.bat`` and wait(Will need from 15 to 25 minutes depending on the system).
- Let it finish and there should be a .ZIP file named ``Cuphead.VPK``.
- Open the VitaShell, connect your PS Vita to your PC and copy VPK file over
- Install the VPK file(it will take a while since vita have very slow IO Speeds.
- Launch the game and have fun!
