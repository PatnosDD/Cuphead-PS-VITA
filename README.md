# Cuphead for PS VITA

This repo contains patches that you can use in order to get fully working files for my port.

**YOU NEED TO BUY THE GAME ON STEAM TO MAKE IT WORK!**

NOTICE: ONLY WINDOWS VERSION IS SUPPORTED, You also need ioplus plugin installed.

Don't try to launch the game, because it will crash without the neccesary files.

## STEAM VERSION
- Download Cuphead vpk from vitadb/github and install it.
- Go to the Release page and download ``CupheadVitaSteam.zip``.
- Extract it.
- Put the game's folder(```..\steamapps\common\Cuphead```) inside the extracted folder(Should be Steam version).)
- Launch ``ApplyPatch.bat`` and wait(Will need from 15 to 25 minutes depending on the system).
- Let it finish and there should be a .ZIP file named ``CupheadVITA_FILES.zip``.
- Open the VitaShell, connect your PS Vita to your PC and copy the contents of the .ZIP file(Not the ZIP file itself, just files inside it) over to ``ux0:app/CPHD23233/``(Picture Below of how it should look after copying everything).
